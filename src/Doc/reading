Reading Assignments for CPSC 323
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note:  The on-line version of Matthew and Stones is not
paginated.  For those using it, I have annotated each
reading with the chapter and section(s) (and in some
cases subsection(s)) in which those pages are contained.

Thus to reach the reading, click on the title of the
chapter in the list of links, which inserts a list of
sections immediately under the title.  If no subsection
is specified below, read the entire page.  Otherwise
just scroll down to the subsection and read to the end
of it.
