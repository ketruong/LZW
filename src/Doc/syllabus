Textbooks
~~~~~~~~~
  John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson, "Computer Architecture:
    A Quantitative Approach", 5th edition, Morgan Kaufman, 2011 (on-line @ Orbis)

Coursework
~~~~~~~~~~
  The class will NOT meet during reading period.

  There will be 6 assignments requiring an average of 6-9 hours per week (or an
  average of 15-25 hours per C assignment, somewhat less per non-C assignment).
  There will be in-class examinations on Monday, October 16th, and Wednesday,
  December 6th.  There will be no examination during final exam period.

  Homework is ~70% of the final grade; the examinations are the remaining ~30%.

Grading
~~~~~~~
  Programs will be submitted electronically and checked using test scripts:  a
  public script, which will generally be available at least one week before the
  assignment is due; and a more comprehensive private script, which will be
  used to assign a grade.  C programs may also be evaluated for style.

Late Homework Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Programs should be submitted electronically by 2:00 am on the day specified
  in the assignment.  Late work not authorized by a Dean's excuse will be
  assessed a penalty of 5% per calendar day or part thereof and may not be
  graded at all if more than ten days late or after solutions are released.
  The submit-times of the sources determine when the program was submitted.

  Note:  If a Dean's excuse would authorize an assignment to be submitted more
    than two weeks late or after solutions are released, then the student may
    be asked to complete an equivalent assignment instead.

Topics Covered/Emphasized (tentative)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Systems programming in a high level language
    user-level interfaces to a typical operating system (LINUX)
    writing programs (e.g., a shell) that interact with the operating system

  Elementary machine architecture / computer organization
    computer arithmetic and general structure/organization of machines
    approaches to parallelism (vector, SIMD, MIMD, networks)
    instruction set architectures and pipelining instruction execution

  Operating systems
    implications of concurrency
    implementation of semaphores at machine level (a la Dijkstra)
    implementation and ramifications of virtual memory and caches

  Other
    data compression; error detection and correction; computer networks

General Statement on Collaboration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Programming, like composition, is an individual creative process in which you
  must reach your own understanding of the problem and discover a path to its
  solution.  During this time, discussions with others (including the instruc-
  tional staff) are encouraged.  (But see the Gilligan's Island Rule below.)
   
  However, when the time comes to write code, such discussions are no longer
  appropriate---the program must be your own personal creation (although
  you may ask the instructional staff for help in writing and debugging).
   
  Since code reuse is an important part of programming, you may incorporate
  published code (e.g., from text books or the net) in your programs, provided
  you give proper attribution in your source and in your log file AND THE BULK
  OF THE CODE SUBMITTED IS YOUR OWN.

  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES COPY ANOTHER PERSON'S CODE OR GIVE A COPY
  OF YOUR CODE TO ANOTHER PERSON---to do so is a clear violation of ethical/
  academic standards that, when discovered, will be referred to the Executive
  Committee of Yale College for disciplinary action.  Modifying code to conceal
  copying only compounds the offense.

The Gilligan's Island Rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  When discussing an assignment with other students, you may write on a board
  or a piece of paper, but you may not take any written or electronic record
  away from the discussion.  Moreover, you must engage in a full hour of mind-
  numbing activity (e.g., watching back-to-back episodes of Gilligan's Island)
  before you work on the assignment again.  This will ensure that you can
  reconstruct what you learned from the discussion, by yourself, using your own
  brain.
